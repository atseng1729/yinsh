# yinsh
Website that hosts Yinsh games using Elm

When compiling, make sure to output to "yinsh.js" and then run withFlags.html for the applet; we load the window size via flags.

elm make src/Yinsh.elm --output=yinsh.js



ARTHUR: To save you some time: 

Submit THESE files only to your svn directory USER-cs223-spr-20/project/part3/
I packaged this into a folder called part3/

index.html
yinsh.js
elm.json
src/*
report.txt 

Submit THESE files into USER-cs223-spr-20/project/part3/release/
I packaged this into a folder called release/

index.html
yinsh.js
elm.json
src/*
Thumb.png
show_name.txt

only reason I'm not submitting is so you can make any last minute changes 
you want in case formatting is bad or something or you hate the new elm-style 
graphics
